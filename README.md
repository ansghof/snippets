# snippets

My personal useful snippets from coding and testing. I've removed all the work related info from them if they were derived from my daily work and changed them to be more generally applicable.

## Stencil-Testing

Stencil sucks! SpecPage creates mock objects for window, navigator, localStorage and so on.
To see how to mock stuff inside before lifecycle hooks are executed, look at the stencil-testing folder.

## Vue-Testing

Vue is much better. Many things work as expected. I'll record some things anyway because I might want to look them up again.

## Vitest

Vitest is a bit like jest but not jest. Not sure yet if all things work the same in both.
